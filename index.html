    <h2>Data Security Checklist & How-To Guide for Small Healthcare Providers</h2>

    <p>Even if your practice is not subject to HIPAA, you still play an important role in protecting your patients' personal and health information. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) encourages businesses to follow sound data security practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices. Taking reasonable steps to secure patient data not only reduces risk, but also helps build trust with the people you serve.</p>

    <h3>1. Start With Security</h3>
    <div class="list-group">
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
           Review your business for data risks
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">Look at where and how you collect, store, and use personal health information and personal identifiable information. Make a list of what data you gather (like names, birthdates, or health details), where it’s kept (paper files, email, software), and who has access. Ask yourself what would happen if this info were lost or stolen.</small>
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
          Only collect the data you truly need
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">Review the forms you use to collect information. If you’re asking for more than what’s needed to provide care or run your business, remove the extra fields.</small>
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
          Keep data only as long as necessary
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">Set a schedule for how long you keep data, both in electronic and paper format. Under the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, you’re allowed to retain children’s personal information “for only as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected.” After that, you must delete it. Other regulations just require that you have a policy for how long data is kept and adhere to that schedule.</small>
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
          Create a simple incident response plan
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">
            If sensitive data is lost, stolen, or accessed without permission, follow these steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Identify the problem. Figure out what happened, what data was involved, and when it occurred.</li>
              <li>Secure your systems. Prevent further access by changing passwords, disabling accounts, or taking affected systems offline.</li>
              <li>Notify your IT provider. Call your tech support person or company to help investigate and resolve the issue.</li>
              <li> Contact your insurance agent. If you have cyber liability coverage, notify them right away.</li>
              <li>Talk to your attorney (if applicable). Legal counsel can help you understand your responsibilities and next steps.</li>
              <li>Notify affected individuals. Let anyone whose information was involved know what happened and how they can protect themselves. Report the breach via the State of Washington Attorney General <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/atg/formhandler/ago/databreachnotificationform.aspx" title="WA AG notification portal">notification portal</a> and the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/health-breach-form" title="FTC health breach form">health breach form</a></li>
              <li>Review and improve. After the situation is resolved, assess what went wrong and update your processes to reduce future risk.</li>
            </ol>
            Keep a printed copy of this plan with up-to-date contact information for your IT provider, insurance agent, and legal support.

          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">

        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">

    <h3>4. Secure Stored and Transmitted Data</h3>
    <div class="list-group">
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
          Encrypt data both in storage and in transit
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">
          What this means: Encryption is a way to make your data unreadable to anyone except those who should have access.
          <br>
          What to do:
          <ul>
            <li>Use tools and services that say they offer “encryption” or “secure” connections.</li>
            <li>Look for “https” in your web address bar — the “s” means it’s secure.</li>
            <li>Don’t email sensitive data unless your email service says it’s encrypted.</li>
          </ul>
          You don’t need to be a tech expert—just make sure the tools you’re using mention encryption, and ask your provider if you’re unsure.
          </small>
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="list-group-item d-flex gap-2">
        <span>
          <input class="form-check-input flex-shrink-0" type="checkbox" value="">
          Ensure encryption is turned on for all laptops and devices
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">If a laptop or tablet is lost or stolen, anyone who finds it could access patient information—unless the device is encrypted. Most modern laptops have built-in encryption tools that can be turned on in settings. For Windows, it may be called BitLocker; for Macs, it's FileVault. You can check with your IT provider or search your system settings for “encryption” to confirm it's active. Encryption helps keep your data safe, even if the device is out of your hands.</small>

          Make sure security tools are set up correctly
          <small class="d-block text-body-secondary">Double-check the settings of your security tools to make sure they’re active, no longer use their default passwords, and are doing the work you expect.</small>
